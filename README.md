# HTML5 games workshop

A workshop that teaches how to develop HTML5 games with JavaScript and [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

It is meant to last a full day, although it includes sufficient guiding for people to finish it at home if only a short session with a coach is possible.

### Running the game (Mac):

Open a local server in terminal: 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open in browser: http://localhost:8000/
